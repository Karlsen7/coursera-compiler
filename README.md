Cool Compiler
=============
This repository holds my solutions to the programming assignments for the Coursera course "Compilers" by Alex Aiken.  For more information, see [the course website](https://www.coursera.org/course/compilers).

I started off using Java in the first assignemnt PA2 but have since switched to C++ for the remainder of the assignemnts.

The goal of these assignments is to build a compiler for COOL(the Classroom Object-Oriented Language).

 * PA2: lexical analyzer
 * PA3: parser
